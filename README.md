Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to design and implement a microservices-based web application with a focus on DevOps practices, containerization, automation, CI/CD, infrastructure as code (IaC), cloud platforms, monitoring, and scaling strategies.

Application Overview:
The microservices-based web application consists of multiple services, including user authentication, product catalog, and order processing. The application is designed to showcase best practices in microservices architecture, containerization, and cloud-native development.

Technologies and Tools Used:
**DevOps Tools:**

Docker for containerization.
Kubernetes for container orchestration.
Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.
Ansible for configuration management.

**CI/CD:**

Jenkins for continuous integration.
Gitlab CI for version control and continuous integration.
AWS CodePipeline for continuous delivery.

**Cloud Platforms:**

AWS for hosting the application.

**Automation:**

Bash Scripting for scripting tasks.
Python Scripting for additional automation.

**Containerization:**

Docker for containerizing each microservice.

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**

Terraform for defining and managing infrastructure.
Ansible for automating configuration management.

**Web Technologies:**

JavaScript and React.js for the frontend.
PHP for backend development.

**Databases:**

MySQL for storing data.

**Microservices and APIs:**

Implement RESTful APIs for communication between microservices.

**Version Control:**

Git for version control.

**Infrastructure Management:**

Linux Systems Administration for server configuration.

**Monitoring and Troubleshooting:**

Prometheus and Grafana for continuous monitoring.
Implement alerting for critical events.

**Scaling and Load Balancing:**

Design a scalable architecture with load balancing.
Implement auto-scaling strategies based on demand.

**Release Management:**

Implement Git-based workflows for versioning and releases.
Set up blue-green deployments for smooth releases.

**Project Steps:**

**1. Application Development:**

Develop individual microservices with RESTful APIs.
Create a frontend using React.js and a backend using PHP.
Set up a MySQL database for storing data.

**2. Containerization:**

Containerize each microservice using Docker.
Create Docker Compose files for local development.

**3. Infrastructure Provisioning:**

Use Terraform to define and provision the required infrastructure on AWS.
Include resources like EC2 instances, VPC, and RDS.

**4. Configuration Management:**

Use Ansible playbooks to automate the configuration of servers.
Configure security groups, install necessary software, and deploy the application.

**5. CI/CD Pipeline:**

Set up Jenkins for continuous integration.
Create Jenkins jobs for building Docker images, running tests, and pushing images to a container registry.

**6. Gitlab CI/CD:**

Configure Gitlab CI/CD pipelines for code quality checks and deployment.

**7. Continuous Delivery:**

Create an AWS CodePipeline for continuous delivery to the production environment.

**8. Monitoring and Alerting:**

Implement Prometheus and Grafana for continuous monitoring.
Set up alerts for resource utilization and application health.

**9. Scaling and Load Balancing:**

Design a scalable architecture with load balancing using AWS services.
Implement auto-scaling strategies based on demand.

**10. Release Management:**
- Implement Git-based workflows for feature development and releases.
- Set up blue-green deployments for smooth releases.

**11. Documentation:**
- Document the entire setup, including infrastructure, deployment processes, and monitoring configurations.

**12. Testing:**
- Implement testing strategies, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
